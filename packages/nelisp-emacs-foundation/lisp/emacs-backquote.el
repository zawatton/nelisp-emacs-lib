;;; emacs-backquote.el --- NeLisp port of Emacs backquote macro  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026 zawatton + Claude

;; This file is part of nelisp-emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Doc 51 Phase 2 — Layer 2.
;;
;; Ports the `backquote' macro from Emacs's `lisp/emacs-lisp/backquote.el'
;; (which itself is the runtime support for the ` reader syntax).  Under
;; regular Emacs the C-level reader emits `(\` ...)' / `(\, ...)' /
;; `(\,@ ...)' forms and the host `backquote' macro handles them, so the
;; `unless (fboundp 'backquote)' guard below keeps this polyfill inert.
;;
;; Under NeLisp standalone the reader emits `(backquote X)' / `(comma X)' /
;; `(comma-at X)' (= per nelisp/build-tool/src/reader/parser.rs symbol
;; conventions).  This file provides the macro expander for those forms
;; using only bootstrap-eval primitives — no `cl-lib', no recursive
;; helper macros, no internal abuse of `\`' to bootstrap itself.
;;
;; Coverage: SINGLE-LEVEL backquote.  Nested ``\`(... \`(...))' forms
;; will mis-expand at the inner level — that case never appears in the
;; anvil-memory / anvil-worklog corpus we are targeting (= grep
;; confirmed zero nested-backquote sites).  Phase 2.1 will add nested
;; support if a concrete need materializes.
;;
;; Algorithm:
;;
;;   `backquote' as a macro on FORM expands to elisp that, when
;;   evaluated, reproduces FORM with `(comma X)' replaced by the value
;;   of X and `(comma-at X)' splicing the elements of X into the
;;   surrounding list.
;;
;;   - Atom F  → `(quote F)`
;;   - `(comma X)`    → X (= eval at expansion target)
;;   - `(comma-at X)` outside list context → error
;;   - List F → recursive cons / append construction:
;;       For each cell:
;;         * head is `(comma-at Y)` → splice (= use `append Y' on tail)
;;         * head is anything else  → cons (= use `cons HEAD TAIL')
