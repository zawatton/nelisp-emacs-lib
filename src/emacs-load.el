T103: `aref' on a string costs on the order of 100 microseconds per
call on this runtime (measured directly; not merely a multibyte-offset
artifact -- confirmed the same order of magnitude on an already-unibyte,
byte-indexed string), so a hand-written scanner that visits every
character of a large file with `aref' is prohibitively slow (tens of
seconds to minutes for a real package file) even though the algorithm
itself is linear.  `emacs-load--artifact-string-search' (native substring
search) costs microseconds regardless of string length (measured:
~3ms for a 200KB haystack). The three `emacs-load--rewrite-*' scanners in
this file use this helper to jump directly between the rare characters
that can start something meaningful to them (a string quote, a comment
semicolon, a backslash escape, and their own specific trigger byte) and
copy every ordinary byte in between through in bulk via `substring',
instead of visiting it one `aref' call at a time."

    "Rewrite `#(...)' propertized-string read syntax in SOURCE to plain calls.
T103: when `emacs-load--propertized-string-reader-native-p' is nil, none of
this runtime's readers reachable from `load' implement Emacs's `#(STR
START END PLIST ...)' read syntax for a propertized string literal.
`read-from-string''s interpreted fallback silently mis-tokenizes it as the
bare symbol `#' immediately followed by an ordinary list -- STR and PLIST
become extra, wrongly-shaped arguments to whatever form contains the
literal, corrupting the parse without signaling anything -- while both the
native whole-string reader (`nelisp--read-all-from-string-native') and
`nelisp--eval-source-string' signal `invalid-read-syntax' on it outright.
Real files carry this syntax (e.g. `evil-common.el': `(overlay-put overlay
\\='after-string #(\"?\" 0 1 (face minibuffer-prompt cursor 1)))'), and
when the literal sits inside a form big or complex enough that the native
per-form reader in `emacs-load--native-read-one' declines to read it,
T78's escape hatch `nelisp--load-eval-source-tail' hands that form whole to
`nelisp--eval-source-string' (or, when the escaped remainder also contains
a `defalias', through `nelisp--load-normalize-source-rewriting''s
`read-from-string'-based reparse first) -- either way turning a
load-bearing but previously silent gap into a whole-file load failure.

Replacing the two-character sequence `#(' with
`emacs-load--propertized-string-literal-marker' turns the construct into
ordinary, fully-supported function-call syntax before any reader ever
sees it: `#(\"?\" 0 1 (face ...))' becomes
`(nelisp-emacs--propertized-string-literal \"?\" 0 1 (face ...))'.
`nelisp-emacs--propertized-string-literal' (below) reconstructs the
equivalent propertized string at eval time.

Ineligible bytes are left untouched: inside a string literal or a comment;
inside a `?X' or `?\\X' character literal (so `?#(' -- the character `#'
followed by a new list, not the start of `#(...)' -- is not mistaken for
propertized-string syntax); and immediately after a backslash outside a
string (an escaped `#' or `(' in a symbol's spelling).  Only a plain,
unescaped, in-code `#(' is rewritten.  This function itself always applies
the transform when asked, regardless of
`emacs-load--propertized-string-reader-native-p' -- callers decide whether
calling it is needed at all (see `nelisp--load-resolved-file').  Returns
SOURCE unchanged (the same string object, no copy) when `#(' does not
occur at all, which is the common case for most files.  Forces SOURCE to
`emacs-load--byte-indexed-source' first (a no-op when already
byte-indexed, which every real `load' caller already is): this function's
own `aref'-based scan must never run on a still-multibyte string, since on
this runtime that means each `aref' recomputes the character's byte offset
by walking from the start of the string -- quadratic in file length, and
the one class of bug this file's other scanners are already documented
\(`nelisp--load-skip-space-and-comments') and tested
\(`emacs-load-test/source-incremental-byte-indexed-source-with-non-ascii-comments-is-fast')

    "Rewrite `#N=OBJECT' / `#N#' labeled/shared-structure read syntax in
SOURCE, for the case where OBJECT is a single atom (symbol, number,
`nil'/`t', or a double-quoted string), into plain repeated text the same
readers `emacs-load--rewrite-propertized-string-literals' targets can
already parse.  T103: real code uses this syntax not to build a genuinely
circular data structure but as a readability idiom for \"this is the same
value as label N\" -- e.g. `evil-commands.el''s `evil-visual-rotate':
`(let ((corners \\='(#1=upper-left upper-right lower-right lower-left
#1#))) ...)'.  Since `upper-left' is a symbol, and symbols are already
`eq' wherever the same name is written, `#1=upper-left ... #1#' has the
exact same value as writing `upper-left ... upper-left' twice; rewriting
the label away this way is a value-preserving text substitution, not an
approximation.

Like `#(...)', none of this runtime's readers reachable from `load'
implement `#N='/`#N#' at all: `nelisp--read-all-from-string-native'
declines, `nelisp--eval-source-string' signals `invalid-read-syntax', and
`read-from-string''s interpreted fallback silently mis-tokenizes
`#1=upper-left' as one bare symbol whose own name happens to start with
the four characters `#1=' (and `#1#' as another bare symbol named `#1#')
-- wrong regardless (a `memq' for the real `upper-left' symbol against a
list that never actually contains it), though unlike `#(...)' this
mis-tokenization alone does not produce a load-time error; the load-time
error T103 tracked down (`(require \\='evil)' dying on this exact form)
comes from the *other* two readers, reached whenever a big/complex enough
form containing this syntax makes the native per-form reader in
`emacs-load--native-read-one' decline (see
`emacs-load--rewrite-propertized-string-literals' for that escape-hatch
mechanism -- identical here, just a different unsupported construct
tripping the same decline).

`#N=' applied to a list or vector -- true shared/circular compound
structure, which cannot be expressed as an equivalent flat rewrite the way
a duplicated atom can -- is deliberately left untouched, and so is any
later `#N#' for a label this function did not record.  This is a known,
documented limitation, not silently wrong: every `#N='/`#N#' use is
already unreadable by every reader this file uses, so leaving the
compound case alone changes nothing for it.  A label reused for a second,
unrelated `#N=...#N#' pair elsewhere in the same file works correctly as
long as each pair's own definition textually precedes its own reference
(the universal convention in hand-written source, and the shape T103's
regression test and the real evil-commands.el both use); a `#N#' that
precedes its own file-wide-unique `#N=' (a genuine forward reference, only
ever produced by a serializer, never by a human) is left untouched like
the compound case.  Returns SOURCE unchanged (the same string object, no
copy) when `#' does not occur at all, which is the common case for most
files.  Forces SOURCE to `emacs-load--byte-indexed-source' first (a no-op
when already byte-indexed): see
`emacs-load--rewrite-propertized-string-literals''s docstring for why an
`aref'-based scanner must never run on a still-multibyte string on this

in SOURCE, computed with the same rules Emacs's reader documents ((info
\"(elisp) Character Type\")): Control on a base in the `[?@,?_]' or
`[?a,?z]' range masks the low 5 bits (Control-`?' is the single documented
exception, giving DEL/127); Control on any other base instead sets the
Control modifier bit (`#x4000000'); Meta always sets the Meta modifier bit
(`#x8000000'), combinable with either Control outcome.  T103: this
runtime's readers get this arithmetic wrong for exactly this shape --
`?\\C-\\[' reads as 28 instead of 27, because the Control mask is applied
to the literal backslash byte instead of to `[' (see
`emacs-load--escaped-modifier-char-literal-reader-native-p' and
`emacs-load--char-literal-escaped-base') -- and `nelisp--eval-source-string'
signals `invalid-read-syntax' on most such literals outright (`?\\C-e' and
`?\\C-?', an unescaped base, read correctly everywhere and are left alone
here).  Real files carry this syntax (e.g. `evil-commands.el''s
`evil-ex-substitute': `(cond ((memq c (list ?q ?l ?\\C-\\[)) ...))'), and
when it sits inside a form the native per-form reader in
`emacs-load--native-read-one' declines to read, T78's escape hatch hands
that form to `nelisp--eval-source-string', turning this into a whole-file
load failure the same way `emacs-load--rewrite-propertized-string-literals'
and `emacs-load--rewrite-labeled-object-references' document for their own
unsupported constructs.

Only a modifier-prefixed ESCAPED base is rewritten; a bare `?\\C-e' is
already read correctly everywhere and is skipped over, not touched (see
`emacs-load--char-literal-modifier-prefixes' and
`emacs-load--char-literal-escaped-base' for what counts as \"escaped\" and
which escapes are resolved).  Returns SOURCE unchanged (the same string
object, no copy) when `?\\' does not occur at all, which is the common
case for most files.  When it does occur, the scan jumps directly between
the rare marker characters that can start something meaningful (see
`emacs-load--next-marker-position') rather than visiting every byte, so a
file with many `?\\'-shaped escapes but no actual Control/Meta modifier
still finishes in a small fraction of a normal file's overall load time
\(T103 first shipped a naive per-character version of this scan that took
10+ seconds on a real ~40KB file for exactly this reason, before this
fix).  Forces SOURCE to `emacs-load--byte-indexed-source' first (a no-op
when already byte-indexed): see
`emacs-load--rewrite-propertized-string-literals''s docstring for why an
`aref'-based scanner must never run on a still-multibyte string on this
runtime."

`#(...)' itself, none of these are forms to evaluate -- PLIST is a literal
property list, not code (`#(\"?\" 0 1 (face bold))' means \"apply property
list (face bold)\", it does not call a function named `face') -- so this
is a macro, not a function: STR and RANGES arrive as raw, unevaluated data,
exactly as `quote''s argument would, and the propertized string is built
once, at macroexpansion time, then wrapped in `quote' -- mirroring how
`#(...)' itself produces one literal object at read time rather than
re-building it on every evaluation.  Only
`emacs-load--rewrite-propertized-string-literals' ever introduces a call
to this macro (replacing the source text `#(' with a call to it, at the
same nesting depth, before any reader sees the construct); it is not
meant to be written by hand.  Each RANGES triple sets PLIST as STR's only
text properties over [START, END) via `set-text-properties', unconditionally
-- a later triple overrides an earlier one for positions both cover,
matching the documented `#(...)' read semantics (Info node `(elisp) Basic
Char Syntax').  This never branches on `propertize'/`add-text-properties'
being fboundp instead: on a runtime where string text properties are not
implemented (a separate, pre-existing gap -- confirmed directly: T103
found `propertize', `put-text-property', and `set-text-properties' all
already silently drop properties on plain strings on this substrate,
independent of this rewrite), `set-text-properties' is a no-op and the
result is a plain string with the right character content and no visible
properties, exactly as any other string constructed on that runtime would
be; `(get-text-property POS PROP STR)' on it then correctly returns nil,
consistent with its documented contract for a string with no properties
at POS.  There is no more-capable primitive to prefer here -- switching
would not change this outcome -- so fixing that gap, if ever wanted, is
core/runtime work, not something this rewrite can or should paper over."

    "Return first non-whitespace/comment position in SOURCE at or after POS.
Whitespace is space, tab, newline, CR, or formfeed.  A comment runs from
`;' through end of line, exclusive of the newline itself (the following
iteration of the whitespace/comment run consumes that newline as
ordinary whitespace).

SOURCE and POS must already share one coordinate space: this function
does not (and must not) convert SOURCE itself, because POS may already
be a position produced by earlier calls in the same scan, and this
runtime's byte-indexed (unibyte) and multibyte representations of the
same text do not share offsets once any non-ASCII byte precedes POS
-- converting mid-scan would silently reinterpret an old, still-valid
POS in the wrong coordinate space.  All real callers already establish
this invariant once, up front: `nelisp--load-map-source-forms' and
`nelisp--load-eval-source-incremental' both call
`emacs-load--byte-indexed-source' on SOURCE before their per-form loop
ever calls this function, and `emacs-load--read-file-string' does the
same to whatever `load' reads from disk.

T94 investigated a real, reproducible superlinear cost in this loop
(bisected on an isolated, unconverted copy of ange-ftp.el's ~30KB GNU
comment header: 1000 bytes 0.04s, 25000 bytes 11.4s) caused by `aref'
recomputing a multibyte string's character-to-byte offset from scratch
on every call.  Two fixes were measured and both rejected:

- Replacing the loop with one `string-match' call over the whole run:
  on this runtime `string-match' is not a fast native primitive for
  this pattern -- it measured 20-50x SLOWER than this loop at every
  size tried, on both multibyte and already-unibyte SOURCE (75.9s vs
  13.2s at 25000 multibyte bytes; 43.5s vs 0.78s at 25000 unibyte
  bytes).
- Converting SOURCE to unibyte inside this function on every call:
  this removes the quadratic cost when POS is 0, but corrupts POS for
  any later call in the same scan once SOURCE contains a non-ASCII
  byte before POS, exactly the class of character-index-vs-byte-offset
  bug documented on `emacs-load--native-read-one' above -- caught by
  this task's own equivalence test before it shipped.

The loop is unchanged from before T94.  What T94 confirmed instead is
that the quadratic case, while real in isolation, is not reachable
through `load' or any other real caller today, because SOURCE always
already arrives byte-indexed (measured flat/linear on unibyte SOURCE:
1000 bytes 0.05s, 25000 bytes 0.78-1.34s, 100000 bytes 4.0s -- the
remaining ~40us/byte here is ordinary interpreted-loop overhead, not
the quadratic defect, and neither rejected fix above improves on it).
See the T94 report for the full measurement, including why
`emacs-load--artifact-source-skip-ws-comments' below -- a pre-existing
duplicate of this exact scan -- now delegates here instead of keeping
its own separate (but equally already-safe) copy."

native reader.  Return (FORM . END-POS) on success, or nil when the
form starting at POS cannot be read this way (see
`nelisp--load-eval-source-incremental' for why that happens and what
callers should do about it).

SOURCE is `emacs-load--byte-indexed-source'-normalized (unibyte on the
standalone runtime).  `nelisp--read-all-from-string-native' does not
reliably terminate when given that representation directly -- T78
measured every call hang regardless of the requested window size, even
a 64-byte one, when handed a real file's unibyte content straight from
`emacs-load--read-file-string' -- it needs the same multibyte conversion
`emacs-load--reader-slice' has always applied before handing a slice to
`read-from-string'.  Converting only a small, geometrically-growing
WINDOW under POS instead of the whole remainder of SOURCE keeps that
conversion a bounded per-form cost instead of one that grows with how
much of the file is already behind POS.

The native reader reports END-POS as a character offset into the
(possibly multibyte-converted) slice, not a byte offset into SOURCE.
For any content with a non-ASCII byte before the form's own end within
the window, those disagree -- multibyte conversion can collapse a
multi-byte UTF-8 sequence into one character -- and returning the raw
character offset as though it were POS's byte-space position corrupts
every later position in SOURCE (T78: this broke standalone boot on
`macroexp.el', which has one somewhere in its 2000+ lines).  Convert
back to a byte count by round-tripping the consumed prefix through
`string-as-unibyte', which recovers SOURCE's original bytes exactly
since it was produced by `string-as-multibyte' in the first place."
