;;; emacs-fns.el --- NeLisp port of Emacs C core fns.c primitives  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026 zawatton + Claude

;; This file is part of nelisp-emacs.

;;; Commentary:

;; Doc 51 Phase 1.6 — Layer 2 (= Emacs C core in Elisp on NeLisp).
;;
;; Ports the standard sequence + property-list primitives that
;; `fns.c' provides in Emacs's C core.  These are foundation
;; functions every Elisp library assumes; they cannot be collapsed into
;; the NeLisp core without violating the "minimal substrate" rule
;; (user 2026-05-02 directive), and they cannot live in any single
;; application (= anvil.el, etc.) without forcing every other
;; nelisp-emacs consumer to duplicate them.
;;
;; Each definition is gated on `unless (fboundp ...)` so loading
;; this file under regular Emacs (= where the real C primitives
;; already exist) is a cheap no-op.  Implementations use only
;; bootstrap-eval primitives (no dependency on the very functions
;; being defined here, no `cl-lib', no `subr-x' tricks).
;;
;; Symbols ported: mapcar, mapconcat, mapc, nreverse, reverse,
;; plist-get, plist-put, plist-member, provide.
;;
;; Out of scope here: cl-* generic versions (= live in
;; `nelisp-emacs/src/emacs-cl-seq.el', not yet shipped).  Hash
;; table, string, and number primitives ship in their own
;; emacs-X.el files.

;; Under host Emacs `encode-coding-string' / `decode-coding-string' /
;; `multibyte-string-p' are C builtins.  NeLisp v1.1.0 (Doc 200) also
;; supplies these string-representation primitives.  Measured on v1.1.0+1,
;; all five names below were already bound and loading this file left every
;; function cell `eq' to its prior value; the runtime also returned nil for
;; `(multibyte-string-p (unibyte-string 200))' and `(227 129 130)' for
;; `(append (string-as-unibyte "あ") nil)'.  Pure Elisp cannot reproduce
;; that representation distinction or byte conversion from character values,
;; so a runtime missing one of these required primitives must fail explicitly
;; instead of silently returning a wrong string.
