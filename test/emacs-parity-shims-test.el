;;; emacs-parity-shims-test.el --- ERT tests for T87 emacs-parity-shims additions  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; `src/emacs-parity-shims.el' guards every definition with `unless
;; (fboundp ...)', so under host Emacs -- which already provides real
;; `subr.el'/`window.el' implementations of every macro this file
;; covers -- the guarded `defmacro' forms never install: there is
;; nothing for host ERT to shadow or call directly.
;;
;; To still exercise the exact ported code (not host's own
;; definition), each test reads the `(defmacro NAME ...)' form
;; straight out of the source file, `eval's it under a private
;; uninterned name, and checks the resulting macro's expansion shape
;; and/or runtime behavior.  Expected shapes were captured from a
;; clean `emacs -Q --batch' (Emacs 31.1) during T87 (see the parallel
;; commentary in `src/emacs-parity-shims.el').
