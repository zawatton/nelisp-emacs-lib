;;; emacs-stub-residuals-test.el --- ERT for Phase 11.C'' residual stubs  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Phase F (2026-05-03) — Doc 51 / nelisp-emacs.
;;
;; Phase 11.C'' deliberately kept sentinel compatibility stubs in
;; `emacs-stub.el' for names whose corresponding prefixed substrate did
;; not exist yet.  The former display probes now use a small capability
;; map keyed by `emacs-display-system'.
;;
;; `define-key-after' has since moved out of residual-stub status via
;; `emacs-keymap-define-key-after' and `emacs-keymap-builtins.el'; the
;; `emacs-stub.el' fallback remains only for minimal load-order
;; compatibility.
;; `window-live-p' and `frame-selected-window' likewise moved to
;; `emacs-window-builtins.el' once the prefixed window model grew real
;; live/deleted predicates and selected-window access.
;;
;; These tests pin the documented sentinel return values so any
;; future replacement (= bridge to a real prefixed impl) cannot
;; silently regress the API surface that callers depend on.
;;
;; Under host Emacs the host's C builtins win, so the kept stubs in
;; `emacs-stub.el' never fire.  We assert two things:
;;
;;   (a) `featurep' / `fboundp' parity (= the stubs load without error
;;       and the unprefixed names are bound, regardless of whether the
;;       binding is host or stub).
;;   (b) Polyfill-body shape parity using literal copies of the stub
;;       bodies — these run regardless of host-Emacs presence and pin
;;       what standalone NeLisp will see when the stub fires.
