;;; emacs-time-test.el --- Tests for emacs-time  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for the time / truncate polyfills split out of `emacs-stub.el'.
;; This file deliberately reloads the module in a controlled way so we
;; can exercise both the host-preserved path and the actual polyfill
;; path without changing the repo sources.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'cl-lib)
