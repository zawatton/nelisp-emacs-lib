;;; emacs-backquote-test.el --- Tests for emacs-backquote  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for the `backquote' polyfill (Doc 51 Phase 2).
;;
;; Tests construct `(backquote ...)` literals explicitly and feed them
;; to `emacs-backquote--expand' so they exercise the polyfill expander
;; regardless of which reader (= host Emacs vs NeLisp) produced them.
;;
;; Variable bindings used inside the backquoted forms are declared as
;; `defvar' (= dynamic / special) so `(eval EXPANSION nil)' (= dynamic
;; eval) sees them.  Using lexical `let' would not work because the
;; polyfill's expansion references the variable by symbol, and lexical
;; `eval' requires the lexical environment to be passed explicitly.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'emacs-backquote)

;; Test fixtures — `defvar'd as special variables so `eval' (dynamic)
;; can resolve them.

That file has no `(unless (fboundp ...))' guard on any of these (every
top-level `defun'/`defmacro' in it was audited: only `zerop' is gated)
because it targets the standalone NeLisp runtime, where none of Emacs's
real `cl-lib'/`subr.el' machinery exists yet.  Loading it into host Emacs
-- as this test does, to reach `nelisp--bq-expand' -- would otherwise
silently replace the host's real, byte-compiled CL and generalized-variable
machinery with NeLisp's minimal reimplementations (e.g. its `cl-position'
is list-only and signals `wrong-type-argument' on a string or vector; its
`setf' and `defsubst' are narrower than the real `gv.el'/`cl-macs.el'
ones and break unrelated stdlib files such as `iso8601.el' the moment
anything later in the same process `require's them), corrupting every
later test in the same host Emacs process.  Save and restore these around
the load so host Emacs keeps its own definitions; only used from
`emacs-backquote-test--ensure-runtime-backquote'.")
