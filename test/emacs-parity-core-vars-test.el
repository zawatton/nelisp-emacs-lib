;;; emacs-parity-core-vars-test.el --- ERT for input-method gap fills (T79)  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; T79: `(evil-mode 1)' on the standalone signalled
;; `(void-variable deactivate-current-input-method-function)' --
;; `evil-core.el's `evil-local-mode' reads that variable directly in a
;; `when' guard while switching evil states, and none of GNU's
;; mule.el/mule-cmds.el/keyboard.c input-method surface was defined
;; anywhere under `src/'.
;;
;; Every definition added to `emacs-parity-core-vars.el' for this
;; ticket is guarded `unless (boundp ...)' / `unless (fboundp ...)', so
;; under host Emacs (where all of it is already real, C-backed or
;; mule-cmds.el-defined) `(require 'emacs-parity-core-vars)' is a
;; no-op and every assertion below exercises Emacs's own primitives;
;; under standalone NeLisp it exercises the port.  Either way the same
;; contract holds -- each value below was read from a clean
;; `emacs -Q --batch' (host Emacs 31.1) before writing the fill.
;;
;; One variable, `input-method-alist', is deliberately not asserted to
;; be `nil' here: `mule-cmds.el' declares its default as `nil', but a
;; real running Emacs has already registered every built-in Quail/LEIM
;; method into it by dump time (via `leim-list.el'), so a fresh host
;; batch process never actually observes the bare `nil' default --
;; only a from-scratch standalone runtime with no LEIM does.  The
;; assertions instead cover what genuinely holds in both places: it is
;; bound, alist-shaped (or empty), and marked `risky-local-variable'.
